# Constrained Bayesian Optimization with Balance CBOB

This is the official implementation of our work on AAAI 2024: "Constrained Bayesian Optimization under Partial Observations: Balanced Improvements and Provable Convergence".


We present an easy-to-use version using GPy. The whole project using GPflow and Trieste can be found in the zip file "cbob_goflow.zip".
